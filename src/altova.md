MissionKit is a software development suite of enterprise-class `XML`, `JSON`, `SQL`, and `UML` tools for information architects and application developers. MissionKit includes `Altova XMLSpy`, `MapForce`, `StyleVision`, and other market-leading products for building today's real-world software solutions

=== `XMLSpy` 
JSON and XML editor offers the world's leading graphical schema designer, a code generator, file converters, debuggers, profilers, full database integration, support for XSLT, XPath, XQuery, WSDL, SOAP, XBRL, and Open XML (`OOXML`), plus Visual Studio and Eclipse integration, and more.
=== `MapForce`
is an award-winning any-to-any graphical data mapping, conversion, and integration tool that maps data between any combination of XML, JSON, database, EDI, XBRL, CSV, Excel, Protobuf, and/or Web service, then transforms data instantly or autogenerates royalty-free data integration code for the execution of recurrent conversions. integration, and more.
=== `StyleVision` 
is an award-winning tool for designing compelling reports and forms based on `XML`, `SQL` database, and `XBRL` inputs. It makes the power of XSLT available in an intuitive and visual design tool, and adds rich content such as eye-catching charts, making it possible for designers and developers to focus on their target designs (in `HTML`, `PDF`, `Word`/O`pen XML`, and other formats) rather than `XSLT` details.  
=== `UModel` 
is the starting point for successful software development. Visually design application models in `UML` and generate `Java`, `C++`, `C#`, or Visual Basic `.NET` code and project documentation. Or, reverse engineer existing programs into `UML 2` software architecture diagrams, then fine tune your designs and complete the round trip by regenerating code. UModel is the `UML` tool that makes visual software design practical for any project.
=== `SchemaAgent`
is a visionary tool for analyzing and managing relationships among `XML`-based files - across a project, an `intranet`, or even an enterprise. SchemaAgent gives you an accurate picture of your `XML` infrastructure in a matter of seconds, giving you the knowledge you need to efficiently manage, edit, and reuse components in a productive, error-free manner.
=== 

With the tools mentioned above it is completely possible to gather and standardize data and create a report with all the features as in the example report. However anyone using these tools will have to have an extensive knowledge of `xml`, `xslt`, `DTD`, `Dita` and `docbook`
