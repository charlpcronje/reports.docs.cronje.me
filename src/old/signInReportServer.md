# Sign into JasperReports Server

3. Log into JasperReports Server by entering the startup URL in your browserâ€™s address field. The URL depends upon your application server. If you installed the default, 

```sh
# bundled Tomcat use:
http://devserv:8081/jasperserver-pro
```

## Log in using the following credentials:

| User ID        | Password     | Description                                 |                     
|----------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|                        
| superuser	     | superuser	| System-wide administrator                   |                                  
| jasperadmin	 | jasperadmin  | Administrator for the default organization  |                     

If you installed the sample data, these additional sample end-users are also created. These users are non-administrative users who have fewer system privileges than an administrative user.

| User ID        | Password     | Description                                 |                     
|----------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|                        
| joeuser	     | joeuser   	| Sample end-user                             |                                  
| demo	         | demo         | Sample end-user for Dashboard demonstration |


When you complete the evaluation or testing of your JasperReports Server instance, change the administrator and superuser passwords (jasperadmin and superuser) and remove any sample end-users. Leaving the default passwords and end-users in place weakens the security of your installation.
