=== Synopsis
My clients need to get more of their marketing and sales staff in the position where they can find the data they needed to be better at making decisions in their respective responsibilities. They wanted to include as many of the staff to use Analytics, to be able to access the newest and live data, to be able to aggregate multiple data sources to get a clear understanding of not just one client's needs but also what is trending, what they need to be careful of and of course to be able to make beautiful charts to blow their client's minds :)

They also need to be able to access the data from anywhere and from their mobile devices. By installing a self hosted report server for them that can collect and combine all of their data sources, we've come a lot closer already to empowering more and more people. They are still sceptic of Machine Learning will be of any benefit for them, but I hope to convince them with some proof soon. So far we've begun to automate some tasks but with machine learning we can also automate the time consuming tasks such as data preparation, virtualization, forecasting and scheduled reports
