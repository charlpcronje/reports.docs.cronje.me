- Oxygen XML Developer is a cross-platform application designed to accommodate all of your `XML editing`, `authoring`, `developing`, and `publishing` needs. It is the best `XML editor` available for document development using structured mark-up languages such as `XML`, `XSD`, `Relax NG`, `XSL`, `DTD`.
- It offers developers a powerful Integrated Development Environment and the intuitive Graphical User Interface of Oxygen XML Developer is easy to use and provides robust functionality for content editing, project management, and validation of structured mark-up sources. Coupled with `XSLT` and `FOP` transformation technologies, `Oxygen XML` Developer offers support for generating output to multiple target formats, including: `PDF`, `PS`, `TXT`, `HTML`, `DOC`, `JavaHelp`, `WebHelp`, and `XML`.
- Using DTD and `XSLT` transformations the `XML` constructed with a server side technology will be transformed to PDF and DOCX
- This solution has proven to work for me in the past but creating the API to construct the necessary `XML` on the server will take some time and as new report structures are needed the `API` will need to be upgraded.

Oxygen XML comes with some extra tools, ie: Oxygen XML Author.
